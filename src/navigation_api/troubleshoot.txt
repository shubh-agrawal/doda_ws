1. Using Audio jack output
- Ensure that snd_bcm2835 sound card is loaded using "aplay -l"
- package "pulseaudio" interferes. remove it
- /boot/config.txt must be added with a line "dtparam=audio=on"

2. https not working in browser and urlib2 [gives ssl error]
- majorly due to out of sync of date, time between internet and local machine
- configure using "sudo date --set '2016-12-23 20:10:05'"

3. Earlier versions of RPI used ttyAMA0 as hardware serial. However in RPI 3, ttyAMA0 
is used as bluetooth controller and ttyS0 is used for serial. This ttyS0 is software controlled
rather than hardware and hence seems slow in working. 
So I have changed /boot/config.txt and added a line dt_param=pi3-disable-bt which brings 
ttyAMA0 back to hardware rules and bluetooth serial is blocked. Now, serials
can be handled on hardware serial. Also command "sudo systemctl disable hciuart"
is necessary.

4. At boot up, the serial ttyAMA0 gets accesed by terminal console for debugging 
purpose. This might cause problem while other peripherals are connected to serial
port.
